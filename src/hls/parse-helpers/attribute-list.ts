/**
 * Certain tags have values that are attribute-lists.  An attribute-list
   is a comma-separated list of attribute/value pairs with no
   whitespace.

   An attribute/value pair has the following syntax:

   AttributeName=AttributeValue

   An AttributeName is an unquoted string containing characters from the
   set [A..Z], [0..9] and '-'.  Therefore, AttributeNames contain only
   uppercase letters, not lowercase.  There MUST NOT be any whitespace
   between the AttributeName and the '=' character, nor between the '='
   character and the AttributeValue.

   An AttributeValue is one of the following:

   o  decimal-integer: an unquoted string of characters from the set
      [0..9] expressing an integer in base-10 arithmetic in the range
      from 0 to 2^64-1 (18446744073709551615).  A decimal-integer may be
      from 1 to 20 characters long.

   o  hexadecimal-sequence: an unquoted string of characters from the
      set [0..9] and [A..F] that is prefixed with 0x or 0X.  The maximum
      length of a hexadecimal-sequence depends on its AttributeNames.

   o  decimal-floating-point: an unquoted string of characters from the
      set [0..9] and '.' that expresses a non-negative floating-point
      number in decimal positional notation.

   o  signed-decimal-floating-point: an unquoted string of characters
      from the set [0..9], '-', and '.' that expresses a signed
      floating-point number in decimal positional notation.

   o  quoted-string: a string of characters within a pair of double
      quotes (0x22).  The following characters MUST NOT appear in a
      quoted-string: line feed (0xA), carriage return (0xD), or double
      quote (0x22).  Quoted-string AttributeValues SHOULD be constructed
      so that byte-wise comparison is sufficient to test two quoted-
      string AttributeValues for equality.  Note that this implies case-
      sensitive comparison.

   o enumerated-string: an unquoted character string from a set that is
      explicitly defined by the AttributeName.  An enumerated-string
      will never contain double quotes ("), commas (,), or whitespace.

   o  decimal-resolution: two decimal-integers separated by the "x"
      character.  The first integer is a horizontal pixel dimension
      (width); the second is a vertical pixel dimension (height).

   The type of the AttributeValue for a given AttributeName is specified
   by the attribute definition.

   A given AttributeName MUST NOT appear more than once in a given
   attribute-list.  Clients SHOULD refuse to parse such Playlists.
